* elfeed-webkit.el

Render [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] entries in embedded webkit widgets.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =elfeed-webkit.el=, put it in
your =load-path= and =require= it.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-webkit
  :ensure
  :after elfeed)
#+end_src

* Requirements

Your Emacs needs to have been compiled with support for xwidgets. Try
=(featurep 'xwidget-internal)= if you're unsure.

* Usage and Customization Options
** Toggle manually

Use =M-x elfeed-webkit-toggle= to toggle webkit on/off in an elfeed
entry buffer. It is recommended to bind that command to a convenient
key in =elfeed-show-mode-map=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-webkit
  :ensure
  :bind (:map elfeed-show-mode-map
              ("t" . elfeed-webkit-toggle)))
#+end_src

** Enable based on entry tags

Elfeed entries can also be rendered with webkit automatically, based
on the entry's tags. This can be useful if you know that a specific
feed /never/ renders well in text. See elfeed's [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/tree/master#autotagging][autotagging feature]] for
how to apply tags to all entries of a given feed.

To set up automatic rendering with webkit, run
=elfeed-webkit-auto-enable-by-tag=.

By default, entries with either a =wk= or =webkit= tag will be affected.
The list of tags that triggers webkit is customizable via
=elfeed-webkit-auto-tags=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-webkit
  :ensure
  :demand ;; !
  :init
  (setq elfeed-webkit-auto-tags '(webkit comics))
  :config
  (elfeed-webkit-auto-enable-by-tag)
  :bind (:map elfeed-show-mode-map
              ("t" . elfeed-webkit-toggle)))
#+end_src

* Keys

In a gist, =elfeed-webkit= uses the default keys available in elfeed
entry buffers, then layers the xwidget webkit keys on top with a
select few customizations.

Here are some of the more commonly used keys:

| Key | Function                                   |
|-----+--------------------------------------------|
| =n= | show next item in elfeed search buffer     |
| =p= | show previous item in elfeed search buffer |
| =u= | mark current entry unread                  |
| =+= | add tag(s) to displayed entry              |
| =-= | remove tag(s) from displayed entry         |
| =g= | refresh displayed entry                    |
| =b= | go back in webkit's browsing history       |
| =f= | go forward                                 |
| =v= | visit current webkit URL in a browser      |
| =y= | yank current webkit URL                    |

As always, use =C-h b= to display all defined keys in a buffer.

- I start out on the =*elfeed-search*= buffer with a few [[https://irreal.org/blog/][Irreal blog posts]], and with webkit rendering disabled.
- I press =RET= to open the selected entry "/Completing Org Links/"; it renders as text.
- I press =t= to toggle on webkit rendering, then =t= one more time to toggle it off again.
- I press =n= to go to the next entry, "/Moving to Elfeed/"; it renders as text.
- I press =n= to go to the next entry, "/Captee/": this entry has the =webkit= tag mentioned before, and automatically renders with webkit as a result.
- I press =q= to quit out to =*elfeed-search*=.
